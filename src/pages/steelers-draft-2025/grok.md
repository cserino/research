### Key Points
- It seems likely the Pittsburgh Steelers will draft a defensive tackle with their first-round pick at No. 21, given recent reports.
- There’s significant buzz about quarterback, but evidence leans toward defensive tackle as the priority.
- Possible picks include Derrick Harmon, Kenneth Grant, or Walter Nolen, with Walter Nolen being a recent favorite.

### Draft Prediction
Based on the latest analysis, the Steelers are most likely to address their defensive line, which has a pressing need after releasing Larry Ogunjobi and with Cam Heyward aging. While quarterback has been a hot topic, recent predictions suggest they’ll opt for a defensive tackle, with Walter Nolen from Ole Miss being a strong candidate at No. 21. However, given the draft’s unpredictability, there’s still a chance they could select a quarterback like Jaxson Dart.

### Team Context
The Steelers have six picks in total, starting with No. 21, and are coming off a 10-7 season. Their strategy seems to balance immediate needs with long-term planning, especially at defensive tackle and quarterback, but the first round appears focused on defense.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Pittsburgh Steelers' 2025 NFL Draft First-Round Pick

The Pittsburgh Steelers are set to make their first-round selection in the 2025 NFL Draft tonight, April 24, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET, with the 21st overall pick. Given the current time is 5:17 PM CDT, the draft is just hours away, and speculation is at its peak. This analysis delves into the latest predictions, team needs, and potential outcomes, providing a comprehensive overview based on recent reports and mock drafts.

#### Draft Context and Schedule
The 2025 NFL Draft is being held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, at Lambeau Field and its adjacent Titletown District, spanning April 24–26, 2025. The first round begins tonight, with Rounds 2–3 on Friday, April 25, at 7:00 PM ET, and Rounds 4–7 on Saturday, April 26, at noon ET. The Steelers, with a 10-7 record last season, earned the 21st pick, reflecting their consistent performance under Head Coach Mike Tomlin, who extended his non-losing season streak to 18 years.

The team has six total picks, as outlined in recent reports:
- Round 1: No. 21 overall
- Round 3: No. 83
- Round 4: No. 123
- Round 5: No. 156
- Round 6: No. 185 (from Seattle through Chicago)
- Round 7: No. 229 (from Atlanta through Philadelphia)

This draft order was finalized earlier, with no compensatory picks for 2025, as noted in [Steelers 2025 NFL Draft slots are set](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-2025-nfl-draft-slots-are-set).

#### Team Needs and Strategy
The Steelers’ roster needs are primarily at defensive tackle (DT), quarterback (QB), and running back (RB), with defensive tackle emerging as a critical area due to the departure of Larry Ogunjobi in free agency and Cam Heyward turning 36 in May. Recent articles, such as one from *The Athletic* dated April 24, 2025, suggest that while there’s been significant buzz about drafting a quarterback, defensive tackle “still appears to be the most likely route at No. 21” ([Pittsburgh Steelers NFL Draft 2025 pick tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6302548/2025/04/24/steelers-nfl-draft-picks-2025-grades-scouting-reports/)). This aligns with FanDuel Sportsbook odds, which list defensive lineman/edge rusher at +180, followed by quarterback at +230 ([What time will the Steelers make their first round pick](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2025/4/22/24408295/what-time-will-the-steelers-make-their-first-round-pick-in-the-2025-nfl-draft)).

The quarterback room remains unsettled, with only Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson currently on the roster, and General Manager Omar Khan has indicated plans to add two more quarterbacks, as reported on April 23, 2025 ([Steelers plan to add two more QBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/steelers-plan-to-add-two-more-qbs-aaron-rodgers-uncertainty-won-t-affect-draft-plans)). This uncertainty, particularly around potential veteran signings like Aaron Rodgers, hasn’t deterred speculation about drafting a QB, but the defensive line need seems to take precedence for the first round.

#### Recent Mock Draft Predictions
Mock drafts have varied, reflecting the complexity of the Steelers’ decision. Here’s a table summarizing recent first-round predictions from major outlets, as of the last few days:

| Source                     | Date       | Predicted Pick               | Position  |
|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| The Athletic               | April 24, 2025 | Walter Nolen                | DT        |
| CBS Sports                 | April 23, 2025 | Kenneth Grant               | DT        |
| NFL.com                    | April 23, 2025 | Jaxson Dart                 | QB        |
| ESPN                       | April 23, 2025 | Shedeur Sanders             | QB        |
| For The Win                | April 23, 2025 | Andru Phillips              | CB        |

This table, derived from [Steelers mock draft roundup](https://steelerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/steelers/2025/04/23/2025-nfl-draft-mock-draft-round-up-steelers/83217336007/), shows a split, with two DTs, two QBs, and one CB in recent predictions. The NFL Mock Draft Database, updated as of April 9, 2025, indicates Jaxson Dart as the most commonly mocked player at No. 21, appearing in 110 mocks ([Pittsburgh Steelers Draft Profile](https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/teams/2025/pittsburgh-steelers)), but more recent reports lean toward DT.

#### Key Candidates
Given the latest trends, the following players are most frequently mentioned:
- **Defensive Tackles**:
  - **Derrick Harmon (Oregon)**: Noted for his run-defense grade of 87.5 in 2024, per PFF, and seen as a fit for immediate impact.
  - **Kenneth Grant (Michigan)**: Highlighted for size and athleticism, addressing the Steelers’ run defense needs post-playoff loss.
  - **Walter Nolen (Ole Miss)**: Recently favored in mocks, such as *The Athletic*’s April 24 prediction, for his potential to bolster the defensive line long-term.
- **Quarterbacks**:
  - **Jaxson Dart (Ole Miss)**: The consensus favorite in earlier mocks, with a 24% chance of slipping out of the first round per ESPN’s Draft Day Predictor ([NFL Draft Day Predictor 2025](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44783169/2025-nfl-draft-day-predictor-forecasts-quarterbacks-running-backs-receivers)).
  - **Jalen Milroe (Alabama)**: Mentioned in recent mocks, such as Sports Illustrated’s April 22, 2025, for his athletic tools, though seen as a developmental prospect.

The Steelers’ extensive homework on running backs, hosting nine for pre-draft visits, suggests they might address RB later, possibly in Rounds 2–3, but Round 1 remains focused on DT or QB.

#### Final Prediction and Uncertainty
Given the most recent information, particularly *The Athletic*’s April 24, 2025, report, it seems likely that the Steelers will draft a defensive tackle, with Walter Nolen being a strong candidate due to his recent prominence in mocks and the team’s need at the position. However, the buzz around quarterback, especially with Dart and Milroe, introduces uncertainty, and the possibility of trading back, as mentioned by GM Khan, could alter the outcome. Therefore, while the evidence leans toward Walter Nolen, DT, Ole Miss, the draft’s unpredictability means there’s still a chance for a quarterback selection.

This analysis incorporates all available data up to today, April 24, 2025, ensuring a comprehensive view for Steelers fans eagerly awaiting tonight’s first round.
