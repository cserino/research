# Pittsburgh Steelers 2025 First-Round Pick Projection

## Steelers’ Needs and Recent Moves
The Steelers hold the **21st overall pick** in the first round tonight ([Draft Blog: Ready to kick things off](https://www.steelers.com/news/draft-blog-ready-to-kick-things-off#:~:text=2025%20Steelers%20NFL%20Draft%20Slots%3A)). Two areas stand out for Pittsburgh: 
- **Quarterback:** 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett hasn’t solidified himself as a franchise QB, and the team “still [doesn't] have a QB1 on their roster” according to one insider ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)). In fact, Pittsburgh even hosted **Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders** on a pre-draft visit, which reportedly went very well ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)). Notably, the Steelers have also been linked to veteran **Aaron Rodgers** in free agency, suggesting they are exploring all options at QB ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=It%20didn%E2%80%99t%20seem%20all%20that,position%20in%20the%20first%20round)).  
- **Defensive Line:** Stopping the run was identified by team president Art Rooney II as a top offseason priority ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=For%20quite%20a%20while%20now,that%20will%20ultimately%20happen%2C%20however)). Longtime stalwart Cam Heyward is aging, and the Steelers haven’t drafted a defensive lineman in Round 1 since 2011 ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=since%20OLB%20T)). This has fueled speculation that Pittsburgh could target a defensive tackle to bolster the interior.  

The Steelers did make a big offensive move already: they **traded their 2025 second-round pick for star WR DK Metcalf**, injecting some playmaking “star power” into a previously stagnant offense ([Bucky Brooks 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Steelers land Shedeur Sanders; Cowboys, Broncos select RBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0-steelers-land-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-broncos-select-rbs#:~:text=Mike%20Tomlin%20could%20view%20Sanders,some%20star%20power%20this%20offseason)) ([Draft Blog: Ready to kick things off](https://www.steelers.com/news/draft-blog-ready-to-kick-things-off#:~:text=First%20Round%20%E2%80%93%2021st%20pick,21st%20pick%20overall)). That trade gives whoever plays quarterback a premier target, but it also leaves Pittsburgh with only one pick in the top 80 (the 21st overall). This amplifies the importance of **nailing their first-round choice**.

## Expert Mock Draft Consensus: Shedeur Sanders 
Over the past 48 hours, **nearly every prominent mock draft** has converged on one name for Pittsburgh at #21: **Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado**. Draft analysts and insiders are overwhelmingly pointing to Sanders as the Steelers’ likely selection if he’s available:
- **NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah** – In his final mock (Apr. 23), Jeremiah projects Sanders to Pittsburgh, calling it a “classic case of need meeting value” ([Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Broncos, Giants trade up; Steelers pick Shedeur Sanders](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)). Jeremiah notes the Steelers might be Sanders’ “last stop” in Round 1 and admits his confidence in the pick is only around 50%, but he couldn’t find a more logical fit past this spot ([Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Broncos, Giants trade up; Steelers pick Shedeur Sanders](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)) ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20legitimate,%E2%80%9D)). 
- **ESPN’s Peter Schrager** – Schrager’s Round 1 predictions (based on league intel) also slot Sanders to the Steelers at 21 ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=21)). He emphasizes that Sanders had *“a good meeting in Pittsburgh”* during a visit and that the team’s current QB situation is unsettled ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)). In Schrager’s words, this would actually be a slight “slide” for Sanders, who some thought could go as high as #3 overall ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=I%20know%20Sanders%20had%20a,Giants%20to%20the%20second%20round)). Landing him in the 20s as the second quarterback off the board is seen as a win for Pittsburgh’s future. 
- **CBS Sports (Mike Renner)** – Renner’s final mock draft likewise has the Steelers stopping Sanders’ fall at 21. He notes Pittsburgh might be *“the only team outside of the top 10”* with a reason to take a first-round QB, making this a natural pairing ([2025 NFL mock draft: Steelers snag Shedeur Sanders, Cowboys trade into top 5 and NFC contenders add WRs - CBSSports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2025-nfl-mock-draft-steelers-snag-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-trade-into-top-5-and-nfc-contenders-add-wrs/#:~:text=)).  
- **NFL.com’s Bucky Brooks** – Brooks projects Sanders to Pittsburgh as well, praising the young QB’s *“confidence, moxie and pinpoint passing skills”* as traits that **Mike Tomlin** would covet. Brooks believes Sanders could *“ignite a dormant offense”* that has added new weapons this offseason ([Bucky Brooks 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Steelers land Shedeur Sanders; Cowboys, Broncos select RBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0-steelers-land-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-broncos-select-rbs#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)). 

It’s rare to see such consensus on a mid-20s pick, but Sanders-to-Pittsburgh has become a **popular prediction** among experts. ESPN’s Todd McShay even stated he believes the Steelers have better than a 50% chance to take Sanders if he’s available ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=The%20hot%20topic%20for%20the,in%20his%20final%20mock%20draft)). In short, the **expert community’s expectation** is that Shedeur Sanders will hear his name called by Pittsburgh tonight.

## Betting Odds and Insider Buzz
The **betting markets** echo this sentiment. Sportsbooks have made the Steelers the **favorites to draft Shedeur Sanders**. For instance, one draft prop had *Pittsburgh selecting Sanders at **-155** odds* (implying roughly a 60-65% probability) ([Spencer Schultz's Top Plays For 2025 NFL Draft - PressBox](https://pressboxonline.com/2025/04/24/spencer-schultzs-top-plays-for-2025-nfl-draft/#:~:text=Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20to%20draft%20Shedeur,155)). According to betting analysts, Pittsburgh emerged as a top landing spot for Sanders, attracting a significant amount of wagers on that outcome ([Spencer Schultz's Top Plays For 2025 NFL Draft - PressBox](https://pressboxonline.com/2025/04/24/spencer-schultzs-top-plays-for-2025-nfl-draft/#:~:text=Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20to%20draft%20Shedeur,155)). This heavy betting action suggests that many bettors — often influenced by insider info and mock draft trends — are **confident Sanders ends up in black and gold**.

That said, not everyone in Steelers circles is convinced it will happen. **Conflicting insider reports** have added some intrigue:
- NFL insider **Daniel Jeremiah** cautioned on draft day that while Pittsburgh is the logical fit for Sanders, his *“confidence level on that happening is at or below 50%”* ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20legitimate,%E2%80%9D)). He wouldn’t be shocked if the Steelers passed on a QB.
- Longtime Pittsburgh beat writer **Gerry Dulac (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette)** has been *“adamant that Pittsburgh won’t take a first-round quarterback,”* suggesting the Steelers might address another position despite the buzz ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=The%20Steelers%20hosted%20Shedeur%20Sanders,take%20a%20first%20round%20quarterback)). This viewpoint implies the team’s interest in Sanders could be a bit of a smokescreen or simply due diligence.  
- The pursuit of **Aaron Rodgers** is a factor here ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=It%20didn%E2%80%99t%20seem%20all%20that,position%20in%20the%20first%20round)). If the Steelers truly believe they can sign the future Hall-of-Famer, they may prefer to use Pick 21 on a non-QB who can help Rodgers (or Pickett) immediately. In other words, a veteran QB option might make Pittsburgh less desperate to draft a rookie signal-caller in Round 1.

In summary, **Vegas odds and most insiders align with Sanders as the pick**, but a few plugged-in voices in Pittsburgh remain skeptical. This split in opinion is what’s causing a bit of last-minute uncertainty, even though Sanders is the clear frontrunner.

## The Leading Projection: Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado
All signs point to **Shedeur Sanders** being the Steelers’ selection at 21, *provided he is still on the board*. Sanders is a highly talented quarterback who threw for over 4,100 yards and 40+ TDs in his final college season ([2025 NFL mock draft: Steelers snag Shedeur Sanders, Cowboys trade into top 5 and NFC contenders add WRs - CBSSports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2025-nfl-mock-draft-steelers-snag-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-trade-into-top-5-and-nfc-contenders-add-wrs/#:~:text=)) ([2025 NFL mock draft: Steelers snag Shedeur Sanders, Cowboys trade into top 5 and NFC contenders add WRs - CBSSports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2025-nfl-mock-draft-steelers-snag-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-trade-into-top-5-and-nfc-contenders-add-wrs/#:~:text=)). He is the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders and showed remarkable poise and accuracy at Colorado, even under intense media spotlight. Here’s why he’s such an attractive option for Pittsburgh:
- **Franchise QB Potential:** Many evaluators see Sanders as a potential franchise quarterback – the type of talent worth a first-round investment. He is widely considered the **No. 2 QB prospect** in this class (behind only Cam Ward) ([2025 NFL mock draft: Steelers snag Shedeur Sanders, Cowboys trade into top 5 and NFC contenders add WRs - CBSSports.com](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2025-nfl-mock-draft-steelers-snag-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-trade-into-top-5-and-nfc-contenders-add-wrs/#:~:text=)). Getting him at 21 could be tremendous value if he develops as hoped.
- **Scheme Fit and Traits:** Sanders is more of a **precision passer** than a raw dual-threat. He’s praised for his *pinpoint passing and “moxie”* in the pocket ([Bucky Brooks 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Steelers land Shedeur Sanders; Cowboys, Broncos select RBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0-steelers-land-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-broncos-select-rbs#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)). Those traits would mesh well with offensive coordinator Matt Canada’s quick-pass system (or any new scheme, should Pittsburgh make changes). Mike Tomlin is said to love Sanders’ confidence and competitive nature ([Bucky Brooks 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Steelers land Shedeur Sanders; Cowboys, Broncos select RBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0-steelers-land-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-broncos-select-rbs#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)), which fits the Steelers’ culture.
- **Maximizing Weapons:** With a revamped receiving corps that now features **DK Metcalf** and young wideouts like George Pickens, the Steelers need a quarterback who can fully utilize those weapons. Sanders showed at Colorado that he can distribute the ball effectively to playmakers. As one mock put it, *“Sanders might ignite a dormant offense”* in Pittsburgh ([Bucky Brooks 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Steelers land Shedeur Sanders; Cowboys, Broncos select RBs](https://www.nfl.com/news/bucky-brooks-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0-steelers-land-shedeur-sanders-cowboys-broncos-select-rbs#:~:text=Colorado%20%C2%B7%20%20QB%20%C2%B7,Senior)). The Steelers offense underperformed in 2024, so injecting a dynamic QB could be the spark it needs. 
- **Team Control and Future:** Drafting Sanders gives Pittsburgh a talented QB on an affordable rookie contract for the next 4-5 years. Even if they sign a veteran like Rodgers for a short term, Sanders could sit, learn, and be the long-term answer. Mason Rudolph is currently the only veteran QB depth, and he’s strictly a backup ([Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Broncos, Giants trade up; Steelers pick Shedeur Sanders](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0#:~:text=Colorado%20%C2%B7%20%20QB%20%C2%B7,Senior)) – Sanders would represent a higher-upside successor.

Overall, **Shedeur Sanders is the consensus projection because he addresses Pittsburgh’s biggest long-term need (quarterback) at the appropriate value**. He has the pedigree and skill set to potentially become the Steelers’ next franchise QB. If he’s available when Pittsburgh is on the clock, the **prevailing expectation** is that the Steelers will turn in the card for Sanders ([Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Broncos, Giants trade up; Steelers pick Shedeur Sanders](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)) ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)).

## Alternate Scenarios to Consider
While Sanders is the favorite, the Steelers have kept their decision close to the vest, so a surprise is still possible. If Pittsburgh **does not** draft Shedeur Sanders (either because he’s unexpectedly taken earlier or they choose to pass), here are the other options being discussed:

- **Defensive Tackle (D-Line Help):** Many believe Pittsburgh would pivot to beefing up the trenches. **Derrick Harmon (DT, Oregon)** is a name frequently linked in that case. Steelers Depot’s final mock draft, for example, has Pittsburgh taking Harmon at 21, citing the team’s emphasis on run defense and Harmon’s alignment versatility on the defensive front ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=For%20quite%20a%20while%20now,that%20will%20ultimately%20happen%2C%20however)) ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=Personally%2C%20and%20for%20quite%20a,more%20sense%20than%20Grant%20does)). Another top D-line prospect is **Kenneth Grant (DT, Michigan)**, whom the Steelers also researched heavily ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=Personally%2C%20and%20for%20quite%20a,more%20sense%20than%20Grant%20does)) ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=Harmon%20and%20Grant%20both%20check,Rodgers%20meeting%20not%20come%20up)). Drafting a run-stuffer would directly address the concern Rooney voiced about improving the run defense ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=For%20quite%20a%20while%20now,that%20will%20ultimately%20happen%2C%20however)), and it would reinforce a defensive line that must prepare for life after Cam Heyward ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=since%20OLB%20T)).
- **An “Unexpected” Quarterback:** If not Sanders, could it still be a QB? One wild-card scenario floated by **Sports Illustrated’s Conor Orr** has Pittsburgh selecting **Jalen Milroe (QB, Alabama)** at 21 ([2025 NFL Mock Draft 9.0: Steelers Take Unexpected QB at No. 21](https://www.si.com/nfl/2025-nfl-mock-draft-first-round-steelers-jalen-milroe#:~:text=21)). Milroe is a dual-threat QB with a powerful running style – Orr compares the idea to how Philadelphia built around Jalen Hurts’ run-heavy attack ([2025 NFL Mock Draft 9.0: Steelers Take Unexpected QB at No. 21](https://www.si.com/nfl/2025-nfl-mock-draft-first-round-steelers-jalen-milroe#:~:text=Pittsburgh%20has%20a%20chance%20to,Now%20he%20can%20recreate%20it)). This is a minority view, but it underscores that Pittsburgh *could* look at a different quarterback if they soured on Sanders for some reason. (Notably, **USC’s Jaxson Dart** is the other top QB in this class, but he’s expected to be gone by pick #9 ([Pittsburgh Steelers Rumors & News](https://www.chatsports.com/pittsburgh-steelers/?offset=1745270761#:~:text=Kinkhabwala%3A%20Jaxson%20Dart%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Fall,9)).) Milroe would be a shocker in Round 1, so consider this a long-shot scenario.
- **Trade Down or Other Positions:** Given that the Steelers lack a 2nd-round pick, they’ve been rumored to consider trading down from #21 to accumulate more picks ([Pittsburgh Steelers Rumors & News](https://www.chatsports.com/pittsburgh-steelers/?offset=1745270761#:~:text=Report%3A%20Steelers%20Among%20Teams%20Open,Late%20First%2C%20Early%20Second%20Round)). If they trade down, a quarterback becomes less likely. They might target positions like offensive line or cornerback later in Round 1. However, there’s been little specific buzz about Pittsburgh eyeing a first-round OL or CB in recent days. The strongest signals remain quarterback or D-line.

In short, the **only real consensus alternative** to drafting a QB is that Pittsburgh could grab a defensive front-seven piece (like a defensive tackle). If Sanders is on the board, bypassing him would be controversial, but the Steelers might do so if they’re truly convinced bolstering the defense (or rolling with a veteran QB) is the better path.

## Conclusion 
**All evidence as of draft day points to the Pittsburgh Steelers selecting QB Shedeur Sanders in the first round**. Virtually every late mock draft from credible experts slots Sanders to Pittsburgh, the betting markets favor it, and Sanders fits a glaring need on the roster ([Daniel Jeremiah 2025 NFL mock draft 4.0: Broncos, Giants trade up; Steelers pick Shedeur Sanders](https://www.nfl.com/news/daniel-jeremiah-2025-nfl-mock-draft-4-0#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders)) ([Spencer Schultz's Top Plays For 2025 NFL Draft - PressBox](https://pressboxonline.com/2025/04/24/spencer-schultzs-top-plays-for-2025-nfl-draft/#:~:text=Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20to%20draft%20Shedeur,155)). The Steelers have done extensive homework on him (including a personal visit) and would be getting a potential franchise quarterback without having to trade up ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)). 

Barring an unexpected turn of events – such as Sanders being taken earlier than expected, or Pittsburgh’s front office pulling a surprise – **Shedeur Sanders is the clear projected pick at No. 21 overall**. This is the pick that **maximizes both value and need**, and it has the most support from experts and insiders alike. 

However, until the card is turned in, nothing is 100% certain. The Steelers have kept their intentions guarded, and a segment of insiders wouldn’t be shocked if Pittsburgh went a different direction (like shoring up the defensive line) ([Bryan: 2025 Steelers Mock Draft - Final Version - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/bryan-2025-steelers-mock-draft-final-version/#:~:text=For%20quite%20a%20while%20now,that%20will%20ultimately%20happen%2C%20however)) ([Jeremiah: Confidence Level 'At Or Below 50%' That The Steelers Select Shedeur Sanders - Steelers Depot](https://steelersdepot.com/2025/04/jeremiah-confidence-level-at-or-below-50-that-the-steelers-select-shedeur-sanders/#:~:text=The%20Steelers%20hosted%20Shedeur%20Sanders,take%20a%20first%20round%20quarterback)). Still, given the overwhelming convergence of mock drafts and the momentum behind Sanders, **the best bet is that Pittsburgh uses its first-round pick tonight to draft Shedeur Sanders, aiming to secure their quarterback of the future** ([2025 NFL mock draft: Peter Schrager's Round 1 pick predictions - ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2025/story/_/id/44790164/2025-nfl-mock-draft-peter-schrager-first-round-predictions-32-picks-trades-buzz-qbs-sanders-ward-dart#:~:text=Shedeur%20Sanders%2C%20QB%2C%20Colorado)) ([Spencer Schultz's Top Plays For 2025 NFL Draft - PressBox](https://pressboxonline.com/2025/04/24/spencer-schultzs-top-plays-for-2025-nfl-draft/#:~:text=Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20to%20draft%20Shedeur,155)).
