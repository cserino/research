            surrounding the 2025 NFL Draft is palpable, particularly in
            Pittsburgh. For the Steelers, a franchise perennially aiming for
            contention, tonight represents a critical opportunity to address key
            roster deficiencies and inject vital talent. The stakes feel even
            higher this year, given the team&#39;s draft capital structure and
            lingering questions at the game&#39;s most important position.</span

            >&nbsp;While Metcalf addresses a need and brings elite talent to the
            offense, the cost was substantial, leaving a significant gap between
            their first selection at #21 and their next pick at #83 overall in
            the third round. This absence of Day 2 premium capital intensifies
            the pressure on the first-round selection and makes strategic
            decisions, such as potential trades, even more critical.</span

            >&nbsp;Fortunately, the 2025 draft class is widely regarded as
            having considerable strength and depth along the defensive line,
            particularly at defensive tackle, making it a logical and
            potentially fruitful area to target early.</span

            bypass a potential franchise signal-caller at #21, hoping Rodgers

            several QB prospects for pre-draft visits, including notable names
            like Shedeur Sanders, Jaxson Dart, Tyler Shough, and Kyle McCord,

            trade down becomes particularly logical if their top 1-2 targets
            (perhaps Harmon and Sanders) are off the board when they pick, or if

                >&nbsp;Selecting Harmon is arguably the safer, more foundational
                pick compared to the gamble on a quarterback amidst the Rodgers
                uncertainty. It solidifies a known weakness with a player who
                fits the team&#39;s identity, allowing the complex QB situation
                more time to resolve. Harmon likely represents one of the
                players on the theorized &quot;limited short list&quot; the team
                would be comfortable selecting at #21.</span

        <span class="c7">Projected Role:</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;Harmon projects as an immediate contributor to the defensive
            line rotation. He could start in the base defense at defensive end
            and rotate heavily with Heyward and Benton in sub-packages,
            providing crucial depth and run-stopping ability from Day 1.</span
        ><span class="c8">16</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;Long-term, he possesses the potential to develop into a
            full-time starter and a successor to Heyward along the defensive
            front.</span

            and Sanders, assuming both are available. This represents a
            fundamental strategic crossroads: solidify the trenches or swing for
            a potential franchise quarterback. If Harmon is selected before pick
            #21, or if the Steelers&#39; internal evaluation prioritizes
            securing a potential long-term answer at quarterback above all else
            (perhaps fueled by pessimism about Rodgers or extreme conviction in
            Sanders), then Sanders becomes the most likely alternative
            selection.</span

            >If Harmon is gone, but the team remains committed to addressing the
            defensive line, other prospects come into play. Kenneth Grant (DT,
            Michigan) offers a massive presence potentially suited for a nose
            tackle role and is another name consistently linked to Pittsburgh.</span
        ><span class="c8">17</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;Walter Nolen (DT, Ole Miss) provides another athletic
            interior option who could be targeted if the top choices are
            unavailable.</span

        <span class="c7 c12">The Trade-Down Scenario</span>
    </p><p class="c1">
        <span class="c11"
            >This remains a very viable alternative, particularly given the lack
            of a second-round pick. If the top tier of targets (likely Harmon,
            Sanders, and perhaps Grant/Nolen) are all off the board by pick #21,
            executing a trade down becomes highly logical.</span
        ><span class="c8">10</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;The goal would be to acquire additional draft capital,
            ideally recouping a pick somewhere between #21 and their next
            selection at #83, allowing them to address needs with greater
            flexibility.</span
        ><span class="c8">9</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;Potential targets after a trade down could still include
            defensive linemen slightly lower on the board (like Ohio State&#39;s
            Tyleik Williams
        </span><span class="c8">16</span><span class="c11 c12"
            >), or addressing running back, cornerback, or offensive line depth
            later in the first or early in the second/third rounds. The absence
            of that second-round pick significantly increases the strategic
            appeal of moving back if the board doesn&#39;t fall favorably at
            #21.</span

        ><span class="c8">28</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;Team draft boards rarely mirror media consensus precisely.
            Late trades can drastically alter the landscape. Could the Steelers
            surprise everyone by targeting a different position if an
            unexpectedly high-value player falls? It&rsquo;s unlikely, but not
            impossible. Could a toolsy QB like Jalen Milroe generate surprise
            first-round buzz?</span
        ><span class="c8">36</span><span class="c11 c12"
            >&nbsp;Again, highly improbable at #21 for Pittsburgh, but
            illustrative of draft night&#39;s potential for chaos.</span

    </p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c12">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c1">
        <span class="c11 c12"
            >Tonight, the Pittsburgh Steelers face a pivotal moment in their
            offseason. Armed with the 21st overall pick but lacking a
            second-rounder, their decision carries significant weight. Analyzing
            the team&#39;s pressing needs &ndash; particularly on the defensive
            line, at quarterback, and running back &ndash; alongside mock draft
            trends, confirmed player interest, and the pervasive uncertainty
            surrounding Aaron Rodgers, points towards a likely course of action.</span
        >
    </p><p class="c1">
        <span class="c11"
            >The most probable selection for the Pittsburgh Steelers at #21
            overall is
        </span><span class="c7">Derrick Harmon, Defensive Tackle, Oregon</span
        ><span class="c11 c12"
            >. This prediction is rooted in the undeniable need to fortify a
            defensive line exposed late last season, Harmon&#39;s prototypical
            fit for the Steelers&#39; scheme and culture, the team&#39;s
            confirmed interest, and the relative safety of addressing a clear
            weakness compared to the high-stakes gamble on a quarterback under
            current circumstances.</span
        >
    </p><p class="c1">
        <span class="c11"
            >Should Harmon be unavailable, or should the organization prioritize
            the quarterback position above all else,
        </span><span class="c7">Shedeur Sanders</span><span class="c11"
            >&nbsp;emerges as the clear primary alternative. The possibility of
            a
        </span><span class="c7">trade down</span><span class="c11 c12"
            >&nbsp;also remains firmly in play, especially if the top targets
            are gone, allowing the team to recoup valuable Day 2 draft capital.</span
        >
    </p><p class="c20">
        <span class="c11 c12"
            >Ultimately, the final answer will be revealed shortly after 8 p.m.
            ET. While Harmon stands out as the most logical and evidence-based
            prediction, the NFL Draft consistently delivers surprises.
            Regardless of the specific name called, the player selected tonight
            will be expected to contribute significantly to the Steelers&#39;
            pursuit of championship contention.</span
